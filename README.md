You should help develop this project, rather than create your own rip-off ;)
The reasoning behind this is that we will all benefit from having "one good source" instead of having multiple "half finished" projects.

Do mind this project is licensed under `Creative Commons BY-NC-SA`.

This is done to protect this source code from being ABUSED for commercial targets. A lot of games are copied and injected with lootboxes; advertisements and then released into the world.

I do not allow any commercial gain out of the software in this project, as it's aim is FUN. If you still would like to market/sell this software or obtain a different license; do contact me.
